# Big Two

## About
Big Two is a famous shedding card game of Cantonese origin. It is played with two - four players.
The Objective of the game is to be the first one to get rid of all cards.

## Rules
### Card Order
Card value is first determined by rank in the following order, lowest to highest:

    3-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, 2  

If two cards are the same, then the higher one is determined by suit order, which is as follows, lowest to highest:  
    
    Diamond, Clubs, Hearts, Spades  

Since the three of diamonds is the lowest value card, it must be the first card that is played at the start of each game, either as a single or part of a combination. 
Thus, whoever has the 3 of diamonds goes first.

### Combinations
Cards can be played as either singles, doubles, triples or 5 card combinations.  
        
    Singles: Any card from the deck, ordered by rank with suit being the tie-breaker.
    Doubles: Any two cards of matching rank, ordered as with singular cards by the card of the higher suit.
    Triples: Three numerically equal ranked cards.
    
Five-card hands: There are five different valid five-card hands, ranking from lowest to highest as follows:

    Straight: Any 5 cards in a sequence, but not all of the same suit. Rank is determined by the value of the highest card. The suit is a tie-breaker.
    Flush: Any 5 cards of the same suit, but not in a sequence. Rank is determined by the suit of the flush. The value of the highest card is used to break ties.
    Full House: a triple and a double. Rank is determined by the value of the triple.
    Four-of-a-kind + one card: Any set of 4 cards of the same rank, plus any card. Rank is determined by the value of the 4 cards.
    Straight flush: Five cards in sequence in the same suit, with suit being a tie-breaker.

The game is broken into rounds, and the combination type for any given round is determined by the player that starts it.  
For example, if the starting player plays 3 of diamonds as a single, then all subsequent plays must be singles for that round (doubles, triples or five card combinations cannot be played).  
The same applies to the rest of the card combinations.
